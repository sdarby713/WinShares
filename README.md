# WinShares
Win Shares is a baseball statistic created by Bill James and explained in his 2002 book, "Win Shares"  (ISBN 1-931584-03-6).  It purports to evaluate a player's worth to his team in a particular season, taking into account hitting, pitching and defensive statistics, plus park effects and a league context.  Although Wins Above Replacement seems to have become the accepted measurement of this value, I still find Win Shares to be an interesting statistic.  But it is fiendishly complicated to calculate, requiring 100 pages to explain (including examples and further explanations).  I'd like automate as much of this as possible.
